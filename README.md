# R_for_Data_Science_Course

These are the scripts I used to accompany my "teaching"/interactive workshops for R for Data Science to my masters students and other interested scientists.

Thanks to Hadley and Garrett for making the text available online (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and including exercises to make it easy to use as a "text".
