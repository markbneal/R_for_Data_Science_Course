## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

echo = false

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

default (echo = true)

```{r pressure2}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Text formatting

*italic text will be in here* or *italic*

**bold text in here** or **bold**

`code will be in here`

superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

## Headings

# 1st level header

## 2nd level header

### 3rd level header

## Lists

-   bulleted item 1

-   item 2

    -   Item 2a
    -   Item 2b

1.  Numbered list item 1
2.  Item 2. Numbers are automatically icremented in the output

Inline code shown here `code(data)`

Inline equation in the middle of a sentence (eg $tau$)

Three ways to insert a code chunk

1.  keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+I)
2.  Insert button
3.  by manually delimiting `{r chunkname} and to close`

```{r table}
mtcars[1:5,]
```

```{r table}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5,],
  caption = "A knitr kable"
)

#gt() #grammar of tables (tidyverse-style)
#DT #stands for data table

```

## Inline code

Sometimes you want numbers in your text that come from code. There were `r nrow(mtcars)` cars.
